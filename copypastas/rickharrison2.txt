Wew lads, crazy dream. I hit my head on the moon, and my then I was rock hard. To relieve some of the clanging from my hotel, I took a visit to the local pawn shop where I met my friend Rick Harrison. He informed me that this was his pawn shop and that he worked there with his sons and old man. He never knows what is going to come through that door. By then my nigga Lil Uzi was pretty upset with me for forgetting to feed his TV since it was on vacation. I tried to apologize but he cock blocked me. By then I was pretty steamed. I told my dog to walk on two legs because we were having a steam boat come to the arcade.
