it sickens me that people associate fidget spinners with autism. I'll have you know that mastering the fidget spinner is no easy feat. You have no idea how much time, effort, and money I allocated into this passion of mine. I had to sell three of my highest quality vape pens and work additional hours at Best Buy in order to be able to afford the limited edition Triple Dragon Deluxe™ fidget spinner. You have no idea how much I trained to master the fidget spinner. Tell me, do you train for 8 hours a day, every day to perfect something you are "passionate" about? Didn't think so. And I'm not even done perfecting my form yet. You see, the fidget spinner is more than just a toy: it is the most unique and inspirational form of art of the 21st century only respected by the most intelligent of people. I highly doubt that the greatest "athletes" put as much time into perfecting their sport as we do into mastering the fidget spinner. Tell me; what "sport" requires as much concentration, effort, flexibility, and intellect than the art of performing the perfect spin? I'll answer that for you: none of them. I swear, if I ever hear someone associate fidget spinners with "autism" ever again, I will be more than willing to put them on the ground. I wouldn't fucking care if I was put into jail. I am more than willing to sacrifice my well-being to defend not just my passion, but my life.
