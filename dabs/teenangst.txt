Then there was one time where
I was sexting my girlfriend
at the time on my kindle
and my mom came into my room
so I quickly put it in sleep mode and closed it
and she questioned what I was hiding and such
to which I was like "nothing" and such
and then I was like "It doesn't matter"
and so she kept asking that I give it to her
and I kept denying it
and then she called my dad down the hall
and he physically muscled it away from me
and wouldn't give it back.
He figured out the password while I was crying
and begging him to give it back
and then I finally convinced him
to give it back by explaining that
I was "talking to a friend about an innopropriate anime"
or whatever and he finally gave it back
